// UnitCatalog.swift -- the Braille Lite unit tab's units: what the emulator's catalog (emu_catalog.c's emc_list, the
// one every emulator shell reads) finds among the firmware the person imported -- the shipped units under their flat
// names, then every release on the table by its content, units/ included -- and nothing more: no firmware, no unit
// (Tomi).  Each unit's memory is kept in the app's own folder, never the App Group's, whose states are the voices'
// and are only ever read here.  A unit's first start: its saved memory, else its factory state beside its firmware,
// else (a release unit, which has none) one made from its firmware by its own recipe into its memory's place.  MIT.
